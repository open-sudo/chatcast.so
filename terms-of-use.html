  <h1>ChatCast Terms of Service</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to ChatCast! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the ChatCast platform (the "Service"), provided by [Your Company Name] ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service. The current version of these Terms was last updated on March 20, 2025.
    </p>
    <p>
      ChatCast allows users to collaboratively chat with an AI via WhatsApp, transforming those conversations into podcasts or videocasts ("Content") published as shorts on YouTube, TikTok, or other platforms. The Service provides templates and customization options, with the entire pipeline managed by ChatCast.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>2. Eligibility and User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
      You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service and have the legal capacity to agree to these Terms. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your WhatsApp account and ensuring that your use of the Service complies with applicable laws, WhatsApp’s terms, and the policies of publishing platforms like YouTube and TikTok.
    </p>
    <p>
      When submitting custom materials (e.g., 9:16 images, music, YouTube links), you must ensure they do not infringe on third-party rights or violate any laws. We are not responsible for the content you provide.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>3. Content Ownership and Licensing</h2>
    <p>
      You retain ownership of original materials you upload. By submitting them, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, modify, and distribute them solely to create and publish your Content. We own the templates, AI-generated outputs, and pre-selected elements (e.g., intro/outro images, Artgrid videos), which you may use under a limited license.
    </p>
    <h3>Third-Party Content</h3>
    <p>
      If you provide a YouTube link, you confirm you have the right to use that content. We will extract and use a 15-second segment as specified, but you are responsible for ensuring compliance with YouTube’s terms and copyright laws.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Content Creation and Publishing</h2>
    <p>
      ChatCast offers templates with pre-set elements like intro/outro images, video bodies, and captions. You may customize your Content with uploaded materials, which are incorporated immediately, subject to moderation. Once created, your Content will be published automatically to your chosen platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to review, modify, or remove Content that violates these Terms, contains inappropriate material, or is technically incompatible with the Service.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>5. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is provided "as is" and "as available." We do not guarantee uninterrupted access, error-free operation, or the quality of AI-generated outputs. We are not liable for issues with third-party platforms (e.g., WhatsApp, YouTube) or damages exceeding $100, to the extent permitted by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      You agree to indemnify us against claims arising from your use of the Service or submitted materials.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Termination and Changes</h2>
    <p>
      You may stop using ChatCast at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access for violations of these Terms or at our discretion. We may also update these Terms, with changes posted on our website. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance.
    </p>
    <h3>Governing Law</h3>
    <p>
      These Terms are governed by the laws of [Your Jurisdiction, e.g., "California, USA"]. Disputes will be resolved in the courts of [Your Jurisdiction].
    </p>
