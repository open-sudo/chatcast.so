  <h1>ChatCast Privacy Policy</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      At [Your Company Name] ("we," "us," or "our"), we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information while providing the ChatCast service (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use ChatCast, effective as of March 20, 2025. By using the Service, you consent to the practices described herein.
    </p>
    <p>
      ChatCast enables collaborative chats with AI via WhatsApp, transforming conversations into podcasts or videocasts published on platforms like YouTube and TikTok. To deliver and improve this experience, we collect and process certain data as outlined below.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We collect information you provide directly, such as your WhatsApp phone number, chat content, and any materials you upload (e.g., images, music, YouTube links). We may also collect metadata (e.g., timestamps, device info) and information generated by the Service, including AI outputs and published Content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, we may collect data from third-party platforms (e.g., WhatsApp, YouTube) as necessary to facilitate the Service, as well as analytics data about how you interact with ChatCast.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      We use your information to provide, maintain, and enhance the Service, including generating and publishing your Content. We may also use it for purposes such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Analyzing usage trends and improving our AI and platform features;</li>
      <li>Personalizing your experience and offering new services;</li>
      <li>Conducting research, development, and training of our technologies;</li>
      <li>Marketing and promotional activities, where permitted by law;</li>
      <li>Ensuring security and compliance with our Terms of Service.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to leverage your data in additional ways that support our business interests, provided such use aligns with applicable laws and this Privacy Policy (as updated).
    </p>
    <h3>Future Use Flexibility</h3>
    <p>
      As our Service evolves, we may explore new ways to use your data, such as developing innovative features, partnerships, or aggregated insights. We will notify you of material changes to our data practices via updates to this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      We may share your information with third-party service providers (e.g., hosting, analytics, publishing platforms) to operate the Service. Your Content will be shared publicly on platforms like YouTube or TikTok as part of the Service’s functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also share data with affiliates, partners, or other entities for business purposes, including potential sales, mergers, or acquisitions. In such cases, we will strive to ensure your data remains protected. We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>5. Data Retention and Security</h2>
    <p>
      We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide the Service and fulfill our business goals, which may include indefinite retention for analytics, AI training, or archival purposes. We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data, but no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge that data shared with third-party platforms (e.g., WhatsApp, YouTube) is subject to their respective privacy policies, over which we have no control.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <p>
      You may stop using ChatCast at any time, though previously published Content or retained data may persist. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your data, or to object to certain uses. Contact us at [Your Email Address] to exercise these rights, subject to our operational needs and legal obligations.
    </p>
    <h3>Consent</h3>
    <p>
      By using the Service, you consent to our collection, use, and sharing of your data as described in this Privacy Policy, including future uses consistent with our business evolution.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices, technology, or legal requirements. Updates will be posted on our website with a revised effective date. Your continued use of the Service after changes signifies your acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>
