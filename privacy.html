        <h1>ChatCast Privacy Policy</h1>
        <div class="content">
          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            At ChatCast ("we," "us," or "our"), we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information while providing the ChatCast service (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use ChatCast, effective as of March 20, 2025. By using the Service, you consent to the practices described herein.
          </p>
          <p>
            ChatCast enables collaborative chats with AI via WhatsApp, transforming conversations into podcasts or videocasts published on platforms like YouTube and TikTok. To deliver and improve this experience, we collect and process certain data as outlined below.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Notice Regarding YouTube API Services:</strong> ChatCast uses YouTube API Services to enable features such as publishing content directly to YouTube. By using ChatCast, you also agree to be bound by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms" target="_blank">YouTube Terms of Service</a> and acknowledge that your use of YouTube is governed by the <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            We collect information you provide directly, such as your WhatsApp phone number, chat content, and any materials you upload (e.g., images, music, YouTube links). We may also collect metadata (e.g., timestamps, device info) and information generated by the Service, including AI outputs and published Content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, we may collect data from third-party platforms (e.g., WhatsApp, YouTube) as necessary to facilitate the Service, as well as analytics data about how you interact with ChatCast.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>YouTube API Data:</strong> When you use features that interact with YouTube, we may access and process information from your YouTube account, such as your channel ID, video titles, descriptions, and privacy settings, as required to publish your content. We do not access your YouTube login credentials. You have full control over titles, descriptions, and privacy status for any video uploaded to YouTube via ChatCast.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>
            We use your information to provide, maintain, and enhance the Service, including generating and publishing your Content. We may also use it for purposes such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Analyzing usage trends and improving our AI and platform features;</li>
            <li>Personalizing your experience and offering new services;</li>
            <li>Conducting research, development, and training of our technologies;</li>
            <li>Marketing and promotional activities, where permitted by law;</li>
            <li>Ensuring security and compliance with our Terms of Service.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong> We and our third-party service providers may store, access, or collect information on or from your devices using cookies or similar technologies to support the operation of the Service, analytics, and to enhance your experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to leverage your data in additional ways that support our business interests, provided such use aligns with applicable laws and this Privacy Policy (as updated).
          </p>
          <h3>Future Use Flexibility</h3>
          <p>
            As our Service evolves, we may explore new ways to use your data, such as developing innovative features, partnerships, or aggregated insights. We will notify you of material changes to our data practices via updates to this policy.

          <h2>4. Sharing Your Information</h2>
          <p>
            We may share your information with third-party service providers (e.g., hosting, analytics, publishing platforms) to operate the Service. Your Content will be shared publicly on platforms like YouTube or TikTok as part of the Service’s functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also share data with affiliates, partners, or other entities for business purposes, including potential sales, mergers, or acquisitions. In such cases, we will strive to ensure your data remains protected. We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>YouTube Data Sharing:</strong> Any data accessed via YouTube API Services is used solely to provide the requested functionality (such as uploading content to your YouTube channel) and is not shared with unauthorized third parties.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>5. Data Retention and Security</h2>
          <p>
            We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide the Service and fulfill our business goals, which may include indefinite retention for analytics, AI training, or archival purposes. We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data, but no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.
          </p>
          <p>
            You acknowledge that data shared with third-party platforms (e.g., WhatsApp, YouTube) is subject to their respective privacy policies, over which we have no control. For YouTube, see the <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
          </p>

          </p>
